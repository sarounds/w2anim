#   The Kindlmann colormap is essentially a rainbow-type colormap with the colors adjusted
#   for increasing luminance, thus making it more perceptually viable.  The colormap was first
#   proposed in a paper by Kindlmann, Reinhard, and Creem.  The codes for this colormap were
#   obtained from Kenneth Moreland and are free to use, modify, and redistribute.

#   The Extended Kindlmann colormap takes the Kindlmann colors and adds more hues and makes the
#   yellows more pink.  The resulting colormap still has increasing brightness.  The colormap

#   The "Jet" colormap is a standard rainbow-like colormap that is NOT perceptually uniform.
#   Many visualizations experts HATE the standard rainbow because of its nonuniformity and
#   because of issues with color-blind perception. Values were generated with the following code:
#     for ($i=0; $i<=255; $i++) {
#         $n = 4 *$i /255.;
#         $r = &min(1, &max(0, &min($n -1.5, 4.5 -$n)));
#         $g = &min(1, &max(0, &min($n -0.5, 3.5 -$n)));

# The X11 color codes are parsed and set up in two hashes:
#  $rgb_name{hex_code} stores the color name
#  $rgb_name{#hex_code} also stores the color name
#  $rgb_code{name} stores the hex code for the color
#
# Then, subroutines are set up to retrieve the values:
#   &get_rgb_name($code) returns the rgb color name, if available
#   &get_rgb_code($name) returns the rgb color code
#
# Note that the color names are not definitive.  Some operating systems
# define color names differently, so the names are nice, but it is the
# rgb codes that are specific.
